As for the configuration of 2D problem, I recommend to remain the same; if you do need you change it and still want to test a 2D test case, you can change the nPOD in field\\_name(Velocity) in svd\\_type in compression. But too many or two small POD number would affect the performance.\n",

    "Another setting could be changed is to change the training method from LSTM to GPR. We using GPR, it needs further setting. The scaling bounds are 0 10. The constant value is 1. The constant bounds are 1e-3 1e3. The RBF length scale is 100. The RBF length scale bounds are 1e-2 1e2. Ctrl + s to save your settings.\n",

Then click a button to go to the second snapshots, click the re-scale button so you can see the result in reasonable colour. Then you can click play button to see the whole animation. If you want to see the original data, go to snapshots and open that in paraview.\n",
